### Guidelines for ASTRO

#### ASTRO_ISLANDS

- Use client:visible directive for components that should hydrate when visible in viewport
- Implement shared state with nanostores instead of prop drilling between islands
- Use content collections for type-safe content management of structured content
- Leverage client:media directive for components that should only hydrate at specific breakpoints
- Implement partial hydration strategies to minimize JavaScript sent to the client
- Use client:only for components that should never render on the server
- Leverage client:idle for non-critical UI elements that can wait until the browser is idle
- Implement client:load for components that should hydrate immediately
- Use Astro's transition:* directives for view transitions between pages
- Leverage props for passing data from Astro to framework components
